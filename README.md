## Project structure

Three directories :
- **doc** : contains the documentation relative to this project and our report
- **exemples** : contains examples to run for the different versions of the algorithm
- **source** : contains the source code of the algorithms

## Requirements
### ⚠ This project needs at least Python 3.6.5 ⚠
#### ⚠ This project requires the python libraries matplotlib and networkx that are used to display graphs and charts ⚠

To install networkx and matplotlib the fastest way is to use pip
    
    pip install networkx   

    pip install matplotlib

If you do not have pip install it <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>

## Use
First you need to create the executables with the make command

    make

Then you can launch the executables algo.ex and stat.ex with python 3.6.5, for example:

    python3 algo.ex

They both have a -h that displays how to use them
